# Drork - React Native Calorie Tracking App

Drork is a React Native app that allows users to create an account, log the foods they consume each day, and calculate their total daily calorie intake. The app simplifies the process of tracking dietary habits and helps users maintain a healthier lifestyle.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create an account with their personal information.

- **Food Logging**: After registering, users can log the foods they eat throughout the day, specifying the name of the food item and its calorie count.

- **Calorie Calculation**: Drork automatically calculates the total daily calorie intake based on the foods logged by the user.

## Todo

- **Calendar Integration**: We plan to implement a calendar system that allows users to view their daily calorie intake history. Users will be able to click on a specific day to see their total calorie consumption for that day.
